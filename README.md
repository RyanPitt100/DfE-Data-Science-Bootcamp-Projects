# DfE-Data-Science-Bootcamp-Portfolio
A compiled list of the various projected developed during the DfE Data Science Bootcamp I am currently studying.

I am expecting to complete the bootcamp content by early February and so this is not a completed list of coding projects. Still to cover in the course are Image Processing and various unsupervised Machine learning algorithms.
